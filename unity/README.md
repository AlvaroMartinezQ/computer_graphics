# Project game made with Unity

This project is composed of different scenes, which are:

1. Island 🏖️ scene: containing some boats, palm trees, a cabin....
2. Desert 🏜️ scene: containing a buried town.
3. Forest 🌲 scene: containing a forest surrounded with mountains.

All scenes have ambient sounds and there're some hidden coins 💎 to collect!

In order to change from one scene to other you'll have to find a __Particle System__ (teleport to the next scene).

Enjoy 🎉
